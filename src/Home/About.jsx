          <p className="text-xl text-white mb-8">
            I am deeply committed to self-improvement and continuous learning,
            especially since the beginning of this year when I started my
            journey to become a web developer. Every day, I dedicate myself to
            refining my skills and expanding my knowledge in technologies such
            as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Node.js, React.js, JavaScript,
            MongoDB, and Firebase.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-white mb-8">
            Through my ongoing journey of self-directed learning, I have worked
            diligently to establish a solid foundation in both front-end and
            back-end development. Additionally, my involvement in volunteer
            activities has greatly enhanced my communication, teamwork, and
            interpersonal skills.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-white">
            I am proud to have achieved notable accomplishments, including
            participation in the Hult Prize Ideal Contest, the ICPC Programming
            Contest, and winning the Tech Debate Contest as part of a successful
            team. These experiences have not only allowed me to apply my
            technical knowledge but have also strengthened my critical thinking,
            problem-solving, and ability to perform under pressure.
